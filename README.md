# The-UWP-Tools-List
An extensive list of potentially useful UWP Tools, Libraries, Samples etc to help make your UWP development more awesome. The list is non-curated with opininated comments when available.




# Information
![awesome-uwp](https://github.com/tomzorz/awesome-uwp) Awesome UWP resources - inspired by Awesome .NET. - It appears to be a "curated" list whereas ![The-UWP-Tools-List](https://github.com/10UWP/The-UWP-Tools-List) is an attempt to include all possibly useful UWP tools and code.

# Frameworks

![MVVM-Sidekick](https://github.com/waynebaby/MVVM-Sidekick) A Modern light-weight MVVM framework based on RX and Await

![MugenMvvmToolkit](https://github.com/MugenMvvmToolkit/MugenMvvmToolkit) Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes it easier to develop cross-platform application using the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern. The Mugen MVVM Toolkit makes extensive use of Portable Class Libraries to provide maintainable cross platform C# native applications.

# Data

![EntityFramework](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework) Microsoft's recommended data access technology for new applications in .NET. Opinionated Note: "Microsoft's recommended data access technology" should not be reporting to ASP.NET which leads to the brain damaged situation of SQLite being the ONLY supported target for Microsoft's main thing, the Universal Windows Platform. The insanely stupid SQLite FK mess means that Entity Framework's Magic Unicorn (Migrations) becomes a useless broken technology on the One Microsoft platform that should count as the highest priority effort. UWP without an easy robust Microsoft supported data platform is a Microsoft blind spot that has been a drag on the success of the Win RT platform from the beginning.  

![BrightstarDB](https://github.com/BrightstarDB/BrightstarDB) BrightstarDB is a native .NET RDF triple store. It uses dotNetRDF to provide support for a wide range of RDF syntaxes as well as SPARQL query support. In addition to providing a raw RDF-based API, BrightstarDB also provides support for binding RDF resources to .NET dynamic objects; and a contract-first entity framework that enables the use of LINQ rather than SPARQL for query purposes.

It is very light-weight with minimal memory footprint. MarcelloDB saves plain C# objects, including child objects, lists and collections. Not having to map your objects to the relational model can save you hundreds of lines of code. MarcelloDB is a pure C# implementation, so there is no need to package other binaries.

![DynamicDataTemplate](https://github.com/kompiuter/DynamicDataTemplate) An example of how to dynamically select a data template based on the data type of an item, including examples in WPF & UWP.
